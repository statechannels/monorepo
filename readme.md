**statechannels** is a simple off-chain framework for building **state channel applications** on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to make it simpler to build permissionless applications that have instant finality with zero-fee transactions.

You can learn more about what state channels are by reading [one](https://l4.ventures/papers/statechannels.pdf) or [other](https://magmo.com/force-move-games.pdf) of the whitepapers underpinning the project, or a less technical written [description](https://medium.com/blockchannel/state-channel-for-dummies-part-2-2ffef52220eb).

### Installing dependencies

**Make sure you have Yarn v1.17.3 installed**. For easy management of specific Yarn versions, we recommend using [Yarn Version Manager (YVM)](https://github.com/tophat/yvm).

To install the dependencies:

```shell
yarn
```

from the monorepo root.

### Building packages

```shell
yarn build
```

### Clean

To clean all packages:

```shell
yarn clean
```

### Lint

To lint all packages:

```shell
yarn lint:check
```

To also apply automatic fixes:

```shell
yarn lint:fix
```

### Tests

To run all tests:

```shell
yarn test
```

### Development Flow

The tests for the `rps`, `nitro-protocol`, `wallet` and `hub` packages need to interact with a local blockchain.

Run the following script _from the root of the repo_ to start a ganache server, deploy the contracts listed [here](./packages/ganache-deployer/src/deployer.ts), and create a common `NetworkContext` object that holds the relevant contract information for the various packages that need to interface with the corresponding deployed contracts.

```shell
yarn start:ganache
```

The `NetworkContext` object is held at a specific path of the `ganache-deployer` package that can be referenced in other packages via `import { getNetworkContext } from '@statechannels/ganache-deployer';`.

Running the above script should produce an output similar to this:

```shell
Writing network context into file: ~/monorepo/packages/nitro-protocol/ganache/ganache-network-context.json

HTTP server listening on port 3000
Starting ganache on port 8547 with network ID 9001
Deploying built contracts to chain at: http://localhost:8547
Contracts deployed to chain
Network context written to ganache-network-context.json
```

The configuration used for this chain can be updated via the `.env` file in the `ganache-deployer` package.

Once this server is shut down, it'll remove the `NetworkContext` object that was created for that instance of the ganache and it should display something similar to:

```shell
Deleted locally deployed network context: ganache-network-context.json
```
