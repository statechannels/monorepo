# validTransition diagram

### Methodology
These flowcharts are made by constructing nodes from the *position types*  from the relevant application commitment solidity file in the `/contracts/` directory, and then constructing edges from the valid transitions defined in the relevant application rules solidity file.

Note that this state machine is transitioned alternately by the two players (cyclicly by n players). This is quite different from a redux state machine, which is transitioned by a single player.

### Key: 
```mermaid

# validTransition

```mermaid
