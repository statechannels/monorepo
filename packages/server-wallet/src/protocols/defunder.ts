/**
 * DefunderResult type is the return value of the crank method. The return value of the crank method
 * should be a boolean in the medium/long term.
 *
 * Why is that?
 * The boolean will represent whether the Defunder protocol has reached the terminal point.
 * This is the pattern established by the ChannelOpener protocol. The caller of the Defunder
 * protocol should not be concerned with internal details of whether a transaction is submitted.
 *
 * What about didSubmitTransaction?
 * In the short term, the ChannelDefunder protocol (which invoked the Defunder protocol) completes
 * upon transaction submission. ChannelDefunder protocol will not be used in the medium term.
 * Most likely, a ChallengeAndWithdraw protocol (which invokes this Defunder protocol) will
 * make the ChannelDefunder protocol aboslete.
