# ðŸ’¼ Embedded Wallet

This package allows you to use a State Channels-enabled dapp with wallets that do not yet support the protocol.

## Usage

For now, it's available for local/development use only.

1. Include the following script in your dapp's web front-end:

```html
<script src="http://localhost:1701/wallet.js"></script>
<script>
   // Enables the EW. This allows to intercept messages sent via postMessage.
   EmbeddedWallet.enable();
</script>
```

2. Add a `request` call anywhere your dapp needs to talk to the wallet. You should be good to go with simply
   requesting `chan_allocate`:

```js
EmbeddedWallet.request({
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: "chan_allocate",
  params: {
    /*...*/
  },
  id: someUniqueNumericId()
}).then(response => {
  // Do something with the response.
});
```

3. Run your dapp.

4. Run the `embedded-wallet` package using `yarn start` on this directory or `yarn run:ewt` on the monorepo's root.
   Make sure the `embedded-wallet` runs on the same address as seen in the `script` include above. If not, adjust
   accordingly.

## Available commands
