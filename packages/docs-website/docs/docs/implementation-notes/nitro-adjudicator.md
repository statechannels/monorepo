Please see the [API](../../contract-api/natspec/NitroAdjudicator).

The Nitro Adjudicator contract extends (inherits from) MultiAssetHolder, which in turn inherits from ForceMove. It therefore inherits all of the functions from those contracts. It also has compound functions for greater usability: for example `concludeAndTransferAllAssets`.
