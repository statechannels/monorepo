As node-js server dev you will only need to author and deploy a single smart contract. These docs will help you do that.

After completing that step, you will want to proceed to the next section, to learn about connecting your Dapp to a statechannels-compliant wallet.

:::note
This section is for developers building server-based Dapps that require a server-based state channels wallet. The instructions are incomplete and should not serve as a reference for deploying your application to production. If you want to do that, please get in touch with our team.
Browser-based applications should use a state channel browser wallet (coming soon).
