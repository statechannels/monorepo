Welcome to the nitro-protocol state channels documentation site. Here you will find documentation that accompanies our smart contracts ([hosted on github](https://github.com/statechannels/monorepo/tree/master/packages/nitro-protocol/contracts) and available as a part of the npm package [@statechannels/nitro-protocol](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statechannels/nitro-protocol)), which implement a state channel protocol outlined in the [nitro white paper](https://magmo.com/nitro-protocol.pdf).

The website features a low level, autogenerated [API reference](./contract-api/contract-inheritance.md) for the contracts, as well as this more loquacious section featuring explanations and tutorials.
