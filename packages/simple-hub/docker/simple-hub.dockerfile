# docker-entrypoint.sh starts a shell that execs the list of arguments in CMD
# This works around the following heroku constraint:
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#dockerfile-commands-and-runtime
#   CMD will always be executed by a shell ... to execute single binaries or use images without a shell please use ENTRYPOINT
# To interactively debug the container:
# docker run -it registry.heroku.com/simple-hub-production/simple-hub:latest bash
